## Paint App

This React project is an online collaborative canvas which allows multiple user to draw on the same canvas.

### Testing

1. Run `npm start` and `node server`
2. This should pop up a blank canvas
3. Open another terminal and run `npm start`
4. You will be able to see drawing on the same canvas on 2 different browser windows.

### Motivation

Next step of this project is:
1. Create more features: Erase, Color Selection, Drawing on Images
2. Utilize Machine Learning for parental control drawings (detect inappropriate drawing)
